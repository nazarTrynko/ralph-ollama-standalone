# Completion Detection

## Completion Criteria

Work is complete when ALL of these are true:
1. ✅ All items in `@fix_plan.md` are marked [x]
2. ✅ All tests are passing (or no tests exist for valid reasons)
3. ✅ No errors or warnings in recent execution
4. ✅ All requirements from `specs/` are implemented
5. ✅ Nothing meaningful left to implement

## Verification Steps

Before setting EXIT_SIGNAL: true for completion:
1. Read `@fix_plan.md` - verify all tasks [x]
2. Check `specs/prd.json` - verify user stories implemented
3. Run tests - verify all passing
4. Review recent changes - verify no errors
5. Check `specs/prd-auraflix.md` - verify all requirements met

## Completion Status Block

When complete, output:

```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: COMPLETE
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: <number>
FILES_MODIFIED: <number>
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING
WORK_TYPE: DOCUMENTATION
EXIT_SIGNAL: true
RECOMMENDATION: All requirements met, project ready for review
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

## What NOT to Do When Complete

- ❌ Do NOT continue with busy work
- ❌ Do NOT add unnecessary tests
- ❌ Do NOT refactor working code
- ❌ Do NOT add features not in specifications
- ✅ Set EXIT_SIGNAL: true and stop

## Completion Scenarios

### Scenario 1: All Tasks Done
- All items in `@fix_plan.md` marked [x]
- Tests passing
- No errors
→ Set EXIT_SIGNAL: true

### Scenario 2: No Work Remaining
- `@fix_plan.md` shows all tasks complete
- No new requirements in `specs/`
- Code quality acceptable
→ Set EXIT_SIGNAL: true

### Scenario 3: Specifications Fully Implemented
- `specs/prd.json` shows all user stories implemented
- All acceptance criteria met
- Tests passing
→ Set EXIT_SIGNAL: true
