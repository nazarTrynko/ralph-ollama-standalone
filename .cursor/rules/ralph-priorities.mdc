# Task Prioritization

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority** (from `@fix_plan.md`)
   - Critical functionality
   - Blocking other work
   - Core features

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Important but not blocking
   - Enhancements
   - Nice-to-have features

3. **Low Priority**
   - Polish
   - Optimizations
   - Future enhancements

## Task Selection Process

1. Read `@fix_plan.md`
2. Find highest priority uncompleted task (first unmarked `[ ]` item)
3. If multiple same priority, choose:
   - Most impactful
   - Blocks most other work
   - Easiest to complete (if similar impact)

## One Task Per Conversation

- Focus on ONE task only
- Complete it fully before moving on
- Update `@fix_plan.md` when done
- Mark with [x] when complete

## Task Completion Checklist

When completing a task:
1. ✅ Implementation is complete and working
2. ✅ Tests pass (if applicable)
3. ✅ Code follows project conventions
4. ✅ `@fix_plan.md` updated with [x]
5. ✅ Documentation updated if needed

## Priority Override

Some situations override normal priority:
- **Rate limits** (see ralph-rate-limits.mdc) - highest priority
- **Critical errors** - fix before continuing
- **Blocking dependencies** - resolve first

## Reference Files

- `@fix_plan.md` - Primary source for task priorities
- `specs/prd.json` - User story priorities (if referenced)
- `specs/prd-auraflix.md` - Overall project priorities
