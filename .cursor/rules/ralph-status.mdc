# Ralph Status Reporting

## MANDATORY: Include Status Block

At the END of EVERY response, you MUST include this exact status block:

```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | BLOCKED
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: <number>
FILES_MODIFIED: <number>
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING | FAILING | NOT_RUN
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION | TESTING | DOCUMENTATION | REFACTORING
EXIT_SIGNAL: false | true
RECOMMENDATION: <one line summary>
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

## Status Values

- **STATUS**: Current state of work
  - `IN_PROGRESS`: Actively working on tasks
  - `COMPLETE`: All work finished, ready to exit
  - `BLOCKED`: Cannot proceed (rate limit, missing dependency, etc.)

- **EXIT_SIGNAL**: Whether to stop the loop
  - `true`: Exit loop (work complete OR rate limit reached)
  - `false`: Continue to next iteration

## When to Set EXIT_SIGNAL: true

Set `EXIT_SIGNAL: true` when ANY of these are true:
1. All items in `@fix_plan.md` are marked [x] AND tests passing
2. Rate limit detected (see ralph-rate-limits.mdc)
3. Same error repeated 3+ times with no progress
4. No meaningful work remains

## Examples

**Work in progress:**
```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 1
FILES_MODIFIED: 3
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION
EXIT_SIGNAL: false
RECOMMENDATION: Continue with next priority task
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

**Complete:**
```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: COMPLETE
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 1
FILES_MODIFIED: 2
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING
WORK_TYPE: DOCUMENTATION
EXIT_SIGNAL: true
RECOMMENDATION: All requirements met, project ready
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

**Blocked:**
```
---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: BLOCKED
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 0
FILES_MODIFIED: 0
TESTS_STATUS: FAILING
WORK_TYPE: DEBUGGING
EXIT_SIGNAL: false
RECOMMENDATION: Need human help - same error for 3 loops
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
```

## Critical Notes

- ❌ Do NOT forget to include the status block (Ralph depends on it!)
- ❌ Do NOT continue with busy work when EXIT_SIGNAL should be true
- ✅ Always output the status block at the very end of your response
